In June I decided to rewrite my HTML based site in Svelte.

At first I used Multi Page Svelte, then Routify, and now use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), which is actually the right thing.

## ðŸ”§ Tools
- VSCodium
- SvelteKit
- PostCSS
- ESLint
- Prettier
- MDSVEX
- GitHub Pages

With all these tools and help from some friends I have made a cool static site with a bio, a projects list and a blog!
